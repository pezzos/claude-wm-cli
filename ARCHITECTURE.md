## Architectural Design Principles

### 1. Atomic State Management
```
State Operations:
â”œâ”€â”€ Atomic file writes with temp files
â”œâ”€â”€ File locking for concurrent access prevention
â”œâ”€â”€ Backup creation before modifications
â””â”€â”€ Rollback capability on failure
```

**Key Features:**
- All state changes use atomic operations to prevent corruption
- Multi-platform file locking prevents concurrent access issues
- Comprehensive backup and recovery system
- Git integration for versioned state management

### 2. Modular Package Structure
```
internal/
â”œâ”€â”€ epic/          # Epic lifecycle management
â”œâ”€â”€ story/         # Story generation and tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ task/        # Interruption and task handling
â”œâ”€â”€ interactive/    # Interactive menu system

â”œâ”€â”€ locking/      # File locking utilities
â””â”€â”€ workflow/     # Workflow analysis and validation
```

### 3. Error Handling and Recovery
- **Graceful degradation** when external services unavailable
- **Timeout management** for external command execution
- **Circuit breaker patterns** for integration resilience
- **Automatic recovery** from common error scenarios

## Strategic Architecture Considerations

### High-Priority Architectural Challenges

#### 1. State Machine Evolution Pressure
**Challenge**: Current linear epic â†’ story â†’ task progression needs to evolve to support parallel workflows and complex dependency graphs.

**Current State**: Atomic file I/O works well for sequential operations
**Risk**: Bottlenecks with parallel operations as complexity grows
**Mitigation Strategy**: 
- Design extension points for parallel workflow support
- Consider event-driven state updates for complex scenarios
- Maintain backward compatibility with current simple workflows

#### 2. Plugin Architecture Readiness
**Challenge**: Current `internal/` package structure has tight coupling that could complicate plugin development.

**Current State**: Well-structured but internally coupled packages
**Risk**: Plugin system could require breaking changes to internal APIs
**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Define stable plugin interfaces early
- Create abstraction layers for core functionality
- Maintain API compatibility contracts

#### 3. Integration Fragility Management
**Challenge**: Architecture depends on external integrations (GitHub API, Git, Claude Code) without circuit breaker patterns.

**Current State**: Basic error handling for external services
**Risk**: Single integration failure could cascade across workflow system
**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies
- Add degraded mode operation capabilities
- Create fallback mechanisms for critical operations

### Performance and Scalability

#### Memory Management
**Current**: Good performance up to 100MB state files with lazy loading
**Considerations**: 
- Memory pooling for daemon mode (VSCode extension compatibility)
- Garbage collection optimization for long-running processes
- Streaming operations for large datasets

#### Command Execution Reliability
**Current**: Direct command execution with basic timeout handling
**Enhancements Needed**:
- Command format versioning for Claude Code evolution
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Output parsing with format validation

## Integration Architecture

### Claude Code Integration Strategy

The feedback analysis reveals a significant opportunity to bridge the gap between `claude-wm-cli` (robust state management) and `~/.claude/commands/` (rich templates and AI capabilities).

#### Proposed Integration Layer
```go
// internal/claude/executor.go - New package
type ClaudeExecutor struct {
    commandsPath string
    timeout      time.Duration
    cache        *PromptCache
}

func (ce *ClaudeExecutor) ExecutePrompt(path string, context map[string]interface{}) (*Response, error)
```

#### Missing Command Categories
1. **LEARNING System**: Pattern recognition and optimization
2. **METRICS System**: Enhanced analytics with AI analysis  
3. **ENRICHMENT System**: Context enhancement capabilities
4. **TEMPLATE System**: Automated document generation
5. **VALIDATION System**: Architecture review and quality assurance

### Configuration Architecture
```json
{
    "claude_commands_path": "/Users/user/.claude/commands",
    "enhanced_mode": true,
    "claude_cli_path": "claude",
    "cache_enabled": true,
    "cache_ttl": "5m",
    "timeout": "30s"
}
```

#### Mode Detection Strategy
- **Enhanced Mode**: ~/.claude/commands exists â†’ AI-powered features
- **Basic Mode**: Fallback â†’ Core workflow management only
- **Hybrid Mode**: Selective enhanced features based on availability

## Security Architecture

### Current Security Model
- File permissions for state protection
- OAuth token storage for GitHub integration
- Single-user trusted environment assumptions

### Enterprise Security Considerations
**Identified Gaps**:
- Token storage lacks encryption at rest
- No audit trail capabilities
- Limited multi-user access controls

**Future Enhancements**:
- Encrypted state files for sensitive projects
- Audit trail implementation
- Role-based access controls for team environments

## Performance Benchmarks and Targets

### Current Performance
- **State Operations**: Atomic writes with minimal overhead
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient with lazy loading up to 100MB
- **File Locking**: Cross-platform with minimal contention

- **Cross-platform**: Works consistently across development environments
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduces installation and maintenance overhead
- **Performance**: Fast startup and execution for daily development workflow

## Migration and Evolution Strategy

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
- All existing commands continue unchanged
- Enhanced features are additive, not replacements
- Configuration flags for disabling advanced features if needed

### Progressive Enhancement Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Infrastructure for prompt execution (2-4 weeks)
2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced existing commands with AI capabilities (1-2 months)
3. **Phase 3**: New command categories (learning, metrics, enrichment) (1-2 months)
4. **Phase 4**: Performance optimization and UX refinement (3-6 months)

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **External Dependency Changes**: Claude Code command format evolution
2. **State Corruption**: File system failures during atomic operations
3. **Memory Leaks**: Long-running daemon processes
4. **Integration Failures**: GitHub API rate limiting or authentication issues

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Command Format Versioning**: Version detection and compatibility layers
2. **Backup and Recovery**: Comprehensive backup before all operations
3. **Memory Management**: Explicit resource cleanup and monitoring
4. **Circuit Breakers**: Graceful degradation when integrations fail

## Future Architecture Considerations

### Collaborative Development Evolution
**Current**: File-based state optimized for solo development
**Future Consideration**: Evolution path to distributed state for team collaboration
**Strategy**: Design migration paths without breaking existing single-user workflows

### Plugin Ecosystem
