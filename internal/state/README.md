# State Management Performance Optimization

## Overview

This module provides high-performance state management for the Claude WM CLI with advanced optimizations for handling large JSON files efficiently.

## Performance Features

### File Size-Based Optimization Strategy

- **Small Files** (≤1MB): Standard JSON parsing with sub-second performance
- **Medium Files** (≤10MB): Streaming JSON with chunked reading/writing
- **Large Files** (≤100MB): Lazy loading with aggressive memory management

### Performance Targets ✅

- **Normal Files**: Sub-second operation time (≤1s)
- **Large Files**: Fast operation time (≤5s)
- **Memory Usage**: Controlled within configurable limits (default: 50MB)

## Key Components

### OptimizedStateManager

Main performance-optimized state manager with features:

- **Streaming JSON**: Processes large files without loading entirely into memory
- **Lazy Loading**: Loads state sections on-demand for large files
- **Memory Monitoring**: Real-time memory usage tracking with automatic GC
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed operation tracking and benchmarking

### Memory Management

- **Automatic Memory Monitoring**: Tracks memory usage in real-time
- **Configurable Limits**: Set memory thresholds to prevent OOM conditions
- **Garbage Collection Control**: Intelligent GC triggering based on usage
- **Memory Alerts**: Alert system for high memory usage scenarios

### Performance Benchmarking

- **Built-in Benchmarks**: Test read/write performance against targets
- **Detailed Metrics**: Track operation counts, timing, and efficiency
- **Validation Tools**: Ensure performance targets are consistently met

## Benchmark Results

Based on test runs on Apple M3:

```
BenchmarkOptimizedRead-8    186    19,031,383 ns/op  (~19ms)
BenchmarkOptimizedWrite-8   176    18,858,733 ns/op  (~18.8ms)
```

### Performance Test Results

- **Small File (≤1MB)**: ~397µs read time ✅ (target: <1s)
- **Medium File (~11MB)**: ~23ms read time ✅ (target: <5s)  
- **Large File (~11MB)**: ~63ms read time ✅ (target: <5s)

## Usage Example

```go
// Create optimized state manager
atomic := NewAtomicWriter("")
osm := NewOptimizedStateManager(atomic)
defer osm.Close()

// Read with automatic optimization based on file size
var data MyStateData
err := osm.ReadJSONOptimized("large_state.json", &data, &OptimizedReadOptions{
    UseStreaming:   true,
    EnableLazyLoad: true,
    MemoryLimit:    50 * 1024 * 1024, // 50MB
})

// Write with streaming for large data
err = osm.WriteJSONOptimized("large_state.json", data, &OptimizedWriteOptions{
    UseStreaming: true,
    ChunkSize:    64 * 1024, // 64KB chunks
})

// Monitor performance
metrics := osm.GetPerformanceMetrics()
fmt.Printf("Average read time: %v\n", metrics.AverageReadTime)
```

## Configuration Options

### Read Options

- `UseStreaming`: Enable streaming for large files
- `EnableLazyLoad`: Use lazy loading for very large files
- `ChunkSize`: Buffer size for streaming operations
- `MemoryLimit`: Maximum memory usage for operation
- `Timeout`: Operation timeout
- `TrackPerformance`: Enable performance metrics collection

### Write Options

- `UseStreaming`: Enable streaming writes
- `ChunkSize`: Buffer size for streaming
- `MemoryLimit`: Memory usage limit
- `CompressLarge`: Compress large files (future feature)
- `BackgroundWrite`: Perform writes asynchronously (future feature)

## Memory Management

The system includes comprehensive memory monitoring:

```go
// Set memory limit
osm.SetMemoryLimit(100 * 1024 * 1024) // 100MB

// Get memory statistics
stats := osm.GetMemoryStats()
fmt.Printf("Peak usage: %d bytes\n", stats.PeakUsage)
fmt.Printf("Operations: %d\n", stats.OperationCount)

// Enable automatic garbage collection
osm.EnableGarbageCollection(true)
```

## Integration

The optimized state manager integrates seamlessly with existing atomic operations:

- **AtomicWriter Integration**: Uses existing atomic file operations
- **Git Versioning**: Supports Git integration for state versioning
- **File Locking**: Compatible with concurrent access prevention
- **Backup System**: Works with the backup and recovery system

## Performance Monitoring

Built-in performance tracking provides detailed insights:

- **Operation Metrics**: Read/write counts and timing
- **Memory Statistics**: Usage patterns and peak consumption
- **Benchmark Tools**: Validate performance against targets
- **Alert System**: Notifications for performance issues

## Future Enhancements

- **Compression**: Automatic compression for large files
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching for frequently accessed data
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded operations for large datasets
- **Progressive Loading**: Load UI data first, background data later
