# Epic Context: CLI Foundation & Command Execution

## Current Epic: EPIC-001
**Status**: ðŸš§ In Progress  
**Priority**: High  
**Started**: 2025-07-25T12:25:04+02:00  
**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 weeks

## Epic Goal
Build minimal viable Go CLI that can execute Claude Code commands reliably with proper error handling and state management. This epic validates the core concept.

## Technical Context
- **Language**: Go
- **Framework**: Cobra CLI
- **Architecture**: Command wrapper around Claude Code CLI
- **Key Requirements**: Reliability, timeout handling, state management

## User Stories in Scope
1. **US-001**: Go CLI Scaffold Setup (High Priority)
2. **US-002**: Claude Command Execution (High Priority)  
3. **US-003**: JSON State Management (High Priority)
4. **US-004**: Basic Interactive Navigation (Medium Priority)

## Implementation Focus
This epic establishes the foundation for all future enhancements. Success criteria:
- Reliable command execution with proper error handling
- Atomic state file management with corruption detection
- Basic interactive prompts for user guidance
- Cross-platform binary builds

## Risk Mitigation
- **High Risk**: Command execution reliability â†’ Implement robust timeout and retry logic
- **High Risk**: State management consistency â†’ Use atomic file operations and Git versioning
- **Medium Risk**: Cross-platform compatibility â†’ Test on multiple OS during development

## Next Actions
Use `/project:agile:design` to create technical design for this epic implementation.
