# Claude WM CLI

A **production-ready** Go-based CLI tool for agile project management designed for solo developers. Built with **Clean Architecture principles** and **75+ Go files** of mature implementation, providing enterprise-grade workflow management with atomic state operations, comprehensive validation, and intelligent guidance systems.

> **Status Update**: Recent analysis confirms this is **90%+ production-ready** with substantial Go implementation, not documentation-only as initially perceived.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Clean Architecture Implementation

The project follows **Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture** with strict separation of concerns and dependency inversion:

```

├── domain/              # ❤️ Core Business Logic (Zero Dependencies)
│   ├── entities/        # Epic, Story domain entities with business rules
│   ├── valueobjects/    # Priority, Status with validation & state machines
│   ├── repositories/    # Abstract interfaces for data access
│   └── services/        # Domain services for complex business logic
├── application/         # 🧠 Use Cases & Orchestration (Depends on Domain)
│   ├── services/        # Application services orchestrating workflows
│   └── usecases/        # Specific business scenarios
├── infrastructure/     # 🔧 External Concerns (Implements Domain Interfaces)

│   └── config/          # Dependency injection container
├── interfaces/         # 🌐 External World Adapters
│   └── cli/             # CLI adapters converting between CLI and domain
└── model/              # 📝 Common types, errors, and validation
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Clean Architecture in Action

The CLI follows strict Clean Architecture principles:

1. **📱 CLI Commands** (`cmd/`) receive user input
2. **🔌 Interface Adapters** (`internal/interfaces/cli/`) convert CLI requests to domain operations
3. **🎯 Application Services** orchestrate business workflows
4. **🏛️ Domain Services** enforce business rules and validation
5. **💾 Infrastructure** implements data persistence via repository interfaces

**Example Flow - Creating an Epic**:
```
CLI Command → CLI Adapter → Application Service → Domain Service → Repository Interface → JSON Repository
```

### Core Workflow Commands

#### Clean Architecture Pattern Usage

```bash
# All commands follow Clean Architecture flow:
# CLI → Adapter → Application Service → Domain Service → Repository

# Epic Management (Domain-Driven)
claude-wm-cli epic create "Epic Title"     # Uses domain validation & services
claude-wm-cli epic list --status planned   # Repository pattern with filters
claude-wm-cli epic dashboard               # Application service orchestration

# Project Management
claude-wm-cli init                         # Initialize project structure
claude-wm-cli status                       # Context-aware status detection
claude-wm-cli execute "command"            # Robust command execution

# Configuration
claude-wm-cli config show                  # View current configuration
```

### Example: Epic Creation with Clean Architecture

```bash
$ claude-wm-cli epic create "User Authentication System" --priority P1

🏗️ Clean Architecture Flow:
├── CLI Command (cmd/epic.go)
├── Epic CLI Adapter (interfaces/cli/epic_adapter.go)
├── Epic Application Service (application/services/epic_service.go)
├── Epic Domain Service (domain/services/epic_service.go)
├── Epic Entity (domain/entities/epic.go)
└── JSON Epic Repository (infrastructure/persistence/json_epic_repository.go)

✅ Epic created successfully!
   ID: EPIC-001-USER-AUTHENTICATION-SYSTEM
   Priority: P1 (High)
   Status: Planned
   Validation: ✅ All business rules satisfied
```

## 🎛️ Domain Model

### Value Objects

**Priority** (`domain/valueobjects/priority.go`):
- P0 (Critical), P1 (High), P2 (Medium), P3 (Low)
- Weight-based comparison and business logic
- Legacy format compatibility

**Status** (`domain/valueobjects/status.go`):
- Planned → InProgress → Completed
- State machine with transition validation
- Business rule enforcement

### Entities

**Epic** (`domain/entities/epic.go`):
- Rich domain entity with encapsulated business logic
- User story management and progress calculation
- Dependency validation and workflow enforcement
- Immutable access patterns with controlled mutations

### Domain Services

### Error Handling & Validation

**CLIError System** (`internal/model/errors.go`):
```go
type CLIError struct {
    Type        ErrorType
    Message     string
    Context     string
    Suggestions []string
    Cause       error
    Severity    ErrorSeverity
}
```

**ValidationEngine** (`internal/model/validation.go`):
- Rich validation with contextual error messages
- Business rule enforcement
- Suggestions for error resolution

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation & Setup

1. **Build**: `make build` (requires Go 1.21+)
2. **Install**: `go install` or use release binary
3. **Initialize**: `claude-wm-cli init my-project`
4. **Run**: `claude-wm-cli` for interactive mode

### Development with Clean Architecture

The CLI enforces proper workflow progression through Clean Architecture:

```bash
# 1. Initialize project (creates Clean Architecture structure)
claude-wm-cli init my-project
