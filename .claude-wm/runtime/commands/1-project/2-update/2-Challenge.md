# /2-Challenge
Analyze project documentation with deep MCP-powered analysis for comprehensive improvement insights.

## Deep Analysis Phase (MANDATORY)
1. **Full Codebase Scan**: Use `mcp__consult7__consultation` to analyze entire project structure
2. **Architecture Analysis**: Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__` to identify structural issues and dependencies
3. **Historical Context**: Use `mcp__mem0__search_coding_preferences` to find past challenges and outcomes
4. **Documentation Review**: Use `mcp__context7__` for current best practices in project documentation

## Enhanced Challenge Process
1. **Document Analysis**: Read ARCHITECTURE.md and README.md thoroughly
2. **Codebase Cross-Reference**: Compare documentation claims with actual code implementation
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify architectural patterns and potential anti-patterns
4. **Dependency Analysis**: Map technical dependencies and potential bottlenecks
5. **Security Assessment**: Evaluate security considerations and vulnerabilities
6. **Scalability Review**: Assess growth and scaling limitations
7. **Generate Strategic Questions**: Create thought-provoking questions based on data-driven insights

## MCP-Enhanced Question Generation
Use insights from MCP analysis to generate:
- **Evidence-Based Challenges**: Questions backed by actual codebase analysis
- **Historical Pattern Challenges**: Questions based on similar project outcomes
- **Best Practice Gaps**: Questions highlighting deviations from current standards
- **Implementation Inconsistencies**: Questions about documentation vs. reality gaps
- **Future-Proofing Questions**: Scalability and maintainability challenges

## Deliverables
Fill docs/1-project/FEEDBACK.md with:
- **Data-Driven Questions**: Backed by consult7 analysis
- **Historical Context**: Including mem0 insights from similar challenges
- **Prioritized Action Items**: Ranked by impact and complexity
- **Best Practice Recommendations**: Based on context7 current standards
No need to fill each part if it's not relevant

## Important
Generate challenging questions backed by concrete evidence from MCP analysis. Focus on strategic improvements that reveal systemic issues rather than surface-level concerns.
