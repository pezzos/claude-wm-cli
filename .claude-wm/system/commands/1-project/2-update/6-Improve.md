# /6-Improve
Execute systematic improvement initiatives based on challenge findings and continuous codebase optimization.

## Systematic Challenge Process
Based on findings from /1-project:2-update:2-Challenge, execute systematic improvements:

1. **Technical Debt Resolution**: Address identified code quality issues
2. **Performance Optimization**: Implement performance improvements from analysis
3. **Security Hardening**: Apply security recommendations from vulnerability assessment
4. **Architecture Refactoring**: Execute structural improvements for better maintainability
5. **Documentation Alignment**: Sync documentation with actual implementation
6. **Dependency Optimization**: Update and optimize project dependencies

## Challenge Questions Generation Process

### MCP-Powered Question Development
1. **Pattern Analysis**: Use `mcp__consult7__consultation` to identify improvement opportunities
2. **Historical Learning**: Use `mcp__mem0__search_coding_preferences` for past improvement outcomes
3. **Best Practice Comparison**: Use `mcp__context7__` for current industry standards
4. **Complex Issue Breakdown**: Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__` for systematic improvement planning

### Question Categories to Generate:
- **Code Quality Questions**: "Why does this pattern exist? What are the alternatives?"
- **Performance Questions**: "What are the bottlenecks? How can we optimize?"
- **Security Questions**: "What are the vulnerabilities? How do we mitigate them?"
- **Scalability Questions**: "How will this handle growth? What are the limits?"
- **Maintainability Questions**: "How easy is this to modify? What makes it complex?"
- **Integration Questions**: "How well do components work together? Where are the friction points?"

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Prioritize by Impact**: Focus on changes that provide maximum benefit
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential negative impacts of changes
3. **Incremental Approach**: Implement improvements in manageable chunks
4. **Testing Integration**: Ensure all improvements are thoroughly tested
5. **Documentation Updates**: Keep documentation current with changes
6. **Learning Capture**: Store successful improvement patterns in mem0

## Deliverables
- **IMPROVEMENTS.md**: Detailed improvement plan with priorities and timelines
- **IMPLEMENTATION.md**: Step-by-step implementation guide
- **TESTING.md**: Comprehensive testing strategy for improvements
- **ROLLBACK.md**: Rollback procedures for each improvement

## Quality Gates
- All improvements must pass existing regression tests
- New functionality must include appropriate test coverage
- Performance improvements must be measurably validated
- Security improvements must be verified through testing
- Documentation must be updated to reflect all changes

## Important
Focus on systematic, evidence-based improvements that enhance long-term project health. Always include comprehensive testing and rollback strategies.
